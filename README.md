# Love Days - Turborepo Monorepo

A modern monorepo setup using Turborepo for the Love Days application.

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `apps/web`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `packages/utils`: a shared utility library used by the web app

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```bash
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```bash
npx turbo link
```

## Getting Started

### Environment Setup

Copy the `.env.sample` file to `.env.local` and update with your Supabase credentials:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

You can find these values in your Supabase project settings > API section.

### Development Server

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Supabase Integration

This project uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for storage of audio files. The audio files are stored in a public bucket named "songs" in Supabase Storage.

### Storage Setup

1. Create a Supabase project
2. Create a storage bucket named "songs" with public access
3. Upload your audio files to the bucket

The Player component will automatically retrieve and play the songs from your Supabase storage.
